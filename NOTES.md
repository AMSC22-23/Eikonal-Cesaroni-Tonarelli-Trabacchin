# SOme comments

Good code. Often you forgot to declare const methods that do not modify the state of the class.
Nice the idea of the double circular list. It is a pity that C++ standard library does not have it.

Nice also the use of cmake. In a more professional CMakeList.txt you should use user definable macro to indicate library/headers (in yours the location of the Eigen library is hardwired).

SO, a part some minor comments the code is good. In the presentation please focus on the parallel implementation. Due to the little time I could not look at it in details.
